# WebMessenger.py
A web messenger created for individual "sites". For the sake of some functions, the speed of work has slightly increased compared to conventional browsers.
the bat file is designed to clear the cache and the correct operation of Whatsapp (I haven't solved this problem yet, I understand that it's about the user agent). Also, videos are not played on some resources. Downloads work correctly, links open only in the current tab
